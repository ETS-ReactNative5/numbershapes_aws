  "standardDescription": "CC.3.NF.1 Develop understanding of fractions as numbers. Understand a fraction 1/b as the quantity formed by 1 part when a whole is partitioned into b equal parts; understand a fraction a/b as the quantity formed by a parts of size 1/b.  (Grade 3 expectations in this domain are limited to fractions with denominators 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8.)",
